# Poketypes
This is just an experiment. I'm learning how to use GitHub and I'm also working on a small script to quickly check the weaknesses and resistance of the various Pokémon types, so here we are.

Basically you enter the opponent's type (or couple of types) and the script will return the most efficient type/s for attacking that pokémon, for example:


'''
Insert the opponent type/s (e.g. flying, steel):
fire, bug

########## 4x damage ##########
rock

########## 2x damage ##########
flying
water
'''
